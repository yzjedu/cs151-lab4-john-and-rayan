    What we needed to acomplish was that we were supposed to write a program to determine how much a customer owes their mobile phone provider based on their subscription package and amount of data used. What were supposed to learn was hoe to be able to calculate when the user exceeds the amount of gb's they already have.
* The steps followed were that first we needed to caluclate everything on a excel. Becuase before we do anything coding related we must test our cases onto a excel file. Techniques we used was just basic math and algebra. Knowing how to add and subtract the right variables from eachother. Key concepts were probally just basic algebra.
* Yes our test cases matched our code. We were able to be succesfull upon that. Yes we used test cases, becuase if we didnt know how to do that then we wouldnt have known how to write our code.
* There were not many challenges that we encountered. Matter of fact this is probally one of easiest labs we have had so far. We used the first levels of programming by first seeing and thinking about what we were doing. Then we just used our heads and solved the math which would work with this lab. All challenges were overcomed becuase we both colloborated hard. When ever one had a issue we could describe and translate it to eachother so we could get a better understanding. Do not really have any keytakeaways. Yes I belive what we were supposed to learn for this lab we have learned. It was great working with john. We were able to colloborate perfeclty with eachother. Did not have any issues regarding anything. Overall great person.
