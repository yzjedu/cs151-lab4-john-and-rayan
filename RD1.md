This lab project faced a lot of new challenges that we had to overcome. I think the outcome of this project has been
good and satisfactory, but there were definitely some issues along the way. I think that my partner has been good with
assisting in this provided task.

The problem at hand required us to once again create all of our plans off of the algorithm, which was of course taken
care of first. Every step of the code had to be one-to-one with the algorithm; no loose ends. If the code, at some point,
needs to add something that deviates from the algorithm, then the algorithm has to be adjusted to fit it. We had to do
this a few times when implementing a few of the "while" statements. The inputs for the extra Gb amounts did not have these
in our algorithm, and we added it to the code, and then to the algorithm. This type of adjustment is pretty much the only
deviation that we allowed from the algorithm. Everything else fully involved it. This was our biggest issue, along with
learning these new "while" statements.

As mentioned before, the biggest key feature of this program was the while operators, as well as the previously learned
Boolean operators. These are incredibly helpful and I will use them for pretty much the rest of the code that we write for
the rest of the semester

My partner was good and very helpful, but again, since we have to write the algorithm in class, it just unintentionally leaves one of our
partners with nothing to do during the lab time. This is not a criticism of partners but a criticism of how the class is
laid out. This problem was especially more present with this lab because of the lack of a flow chart this time around.
We also never get to the coding part in time in class, so the code pretty much always has to be done outside of it.

But this project turned out well and I am very glad to have worked with my partner. It works, it's detailed, and it lines
up with the steps of the algorithm. These are the most important outcomes of the lab and I think the process went well
here.
